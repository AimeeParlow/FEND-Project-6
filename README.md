## How to Run

Step 1:
Please clone or download all related files from [HERE](https://github.com/AimeeParlow/FEND-Project-6)

Step 2:
Open the folder by Git Bash and use Python to show the site on your browser.
Simply write on Git Bash as;

* 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000' for Version 2.x

* 'python3 -m http.server 8000' for version 3.x

In my case, I installed version 3.7 but none of them above did work.
If this happens on you too, please try to type;

* 'py -m http.server 8000'

If you don't have Python in your PC, you can download from its [website](https://www.python.org/).

Step 3:
Once the server running, open 'http://localhost:8000' by your browser.
